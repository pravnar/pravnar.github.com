    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Genres in music can be a good way to differentiate certain works from others, but I don&#8217;t see much use for them when in search of new music to listen to. <!-- more -->I usually find myself struggling to predict a type of music that I would always prefer over any other. Some of the most played artists in my collection are ones that I discovered either by accident or after drifting astray during a search for something entirely different. There is a quality to music that can transcend genres, something that speaks to me the first time I hear a song, reinforcing my conviction that anyone can enjoy elements of any broad category of music.</p>

<p>This is why I was intrigued when I stumbled upon the &#8220;Braindance&#8221; genre used to describe the &#8220;otherwise uncategorizable output of Rephlex Records&#8221; <sup><a href="#wiki">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>braindance is the genre that encompasses the best elements of all genres,
e.g traditional, classical, electronic music, popular, modern, industrial, ambient,
hip hop, electro, house, techno, breakbeat, hardcore, ragga, garage, drum and bass, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here was something that seemed ideal, the best of every world! Imagine my shock when I tried to listen to AFX (a prominent artist and the label&#8217;s co-founder) for the first time and completely hate it. A few months later, however, a friend plays a track for me and I love it, and of course it is by AFX. Since then I have devoured most of his catalogue, and am looking forward to the other artists on Rephlex. Talk about the erraticism of one&#8217;s musical tastes.</p>

<p>It would be a stretch to think of this as &#8220;the genre to replace every genre&#8221; but in my listening experience, artists associated with braindance go the furthest in removing restictions that might be imposed by stylistic conventions. This brings in an element of surprise to their works, which are all characterized by a refreshing detachment from trying to appeal to prevalent traditions and popular techniques.</p>

<p>I will conclude by sharing this very tongue in cheek banner on the old Rephlex website:</p>

<blockquote><p>braindance is not so much a style of music but a way of life.
it&#8217;s difficult to elaborate further but
if you buy all our releases,
you should have a better grasp of the concept.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At lunch the other day there was a discussion about the recent trend of crowdsourcing hard problems. Soon enough someone mentioned Duolingo<!-- more -->, a free language learning service, as an example where the task of translating small pieces of text is posed as one of the learning exercises for the users. The concept sounded familiar to me, as I vaguely recalled the reCAPTCHA project and its effective use of crowdsourcing towards digitizing books. This familiarity made sense later, upon reading that both projects were started by the same group at Carnegie Mellon. I was intrigued by descriptions of Duolingo&#8217;s &#8220;gamification&#8221; approach to learning, with many reviewers citing the service as addictive and fun. Hmm, perhaps it is time to learn a new language?</p>

<p>How hard could it be? I am by no means a polyglot, but I can speak three languages and can read and write two of them, although they were all learnt during my childhood. I guess that the answer could depend on my motivations behind learning a new language. Do I want to add another language to my &#8220;bag&#8221;? Do I feel an immediate practical need for it? How important is it to <a href="http://speakfromday1.com/">speak from day 1</a>?</p>

<p>One friend of mine is currently learning Japanese, purely to back up his interests in traveling there. Another friend decided to learn Swedish in order to converse with his girlfriend&#8217;s family, with her reciprocating by learning Turkish. Either of these languages can be considerably harder to pick up than some the options provided at Duolingo. I suppose I have plenty of inspiration around me, so why not pick up, say Spanish for a start?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have decided to write 180 posts in the next 180 days. <!-- more --></p>

<p>My desire to write better was the reason for starting this blog, which I did over eight months ago. Who knows what happened between then and now. I have recently noticed an increasing muddiness behind my thoughts, and for what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;m hoping to clear that out by continuously sharing ideas.</p>

<p>I was more immediately inspired by Jennifer Dewalt&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in-180">brilliant post</a> and the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6097155">comments at hacker news</a>. Let&#8217;s see how this turns out!</p>
