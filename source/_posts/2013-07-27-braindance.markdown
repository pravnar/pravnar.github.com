Genres in music can be a good way to differentiate certain works from others, but I don't see much use for them when in search of new music to listen to. <!-- more -->I usually find myself struggling to predict a type of music that I would always prefer over any other. Some of the most played artists in my collection are ones that I discovered either by accident or after drifting astray during a search for something entirely different. There is a quality to music that can transcend genres, something that speaks to me the first time I hear a song, reinforcing my conviction that anyone can enjoy elements of any broad category of music. 

This is why I was intrigued when I stumbled upon the "Braindance" genre used to describe the "otherwise uncategorizable output of Rephlex Records" <sup>[1](#wiki)</sup>:

> braindance is the genre that encompasses the best elements of all genres,
> e.g traditional, classical, electronic music, popular, modern, industrial, ambient, 
> hip hop, electro, house, techno, breakbeat, hardcore, ragga, garage, drum and bass, etc.

Here was something that seemed ideal, the best of every world! Imagine my shock when I tried to listen to AFX (a prominent artist and the label's co-founder) for the first time and completely hate it. A few months later, however, a friend plays a track for me and I love it, and of course it is by AFX. Since then I have devoured most of his catalogue, and am looking forward to the other artists on Rephlex. Talk about the erraticism of one's musical tastes.

It would be a stretch to think of this as "the genre to replace every genre" but in my listening experience, artists associated with braindance go the furthest in removing restictions that might be imposed by stylistic conventions. This brings in an element of surprise to their works, which are all characterized by a refreshing detachment from trying to appeal to prevalent traditions and popular techniques.

I will conclude by sharing this very tongue in cheek banner on the old Rephlex website:
> braindance is not so much a style of music but a way of life.
> it's difficult to elaborate further but
> if you buy all our releases,
> you should have a better grasp of the concept.
