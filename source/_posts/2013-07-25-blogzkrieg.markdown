I have decided to write 180 posts in the next 180 days. <!-- more -->

My desire to write better was the reason for starting this blog, which I did over eight months ago. Who knows what happened between then and now. I have recently noticed an increasing muddiness behind my thoughts, and for what it's worth, I'm hoping to clear that out by continuously sharing ideas. 

I was more immediately inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's [brilliant post](http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in-180) and the [comments at hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6097155). Let's see how this turns out!
